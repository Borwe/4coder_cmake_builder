# **4coder CMake Builder**

### Purpose:

Perform super builds of custom layer using cmake, making it less operating system dependent, but simple single cmake script, which also generates a compile_commands.json which is helpful to those who are more familiar with LSP supporting editors, making it easier to parse through 4coder code base, and enjoy, with simple transition into 4coder eventually.
